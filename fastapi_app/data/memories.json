One of the best days spent so much joking cracking jokes and craziness through the streets of Karol bagh looking for suits and lehengas and what not. You bought so tasty home cooked food for me and walking was so tiring and fun with you, felt so much comfortable. We also went to Lajpat Nagar for shopping, damn we were so tired as hell, legs were not feeling like moving hehe. Bestest day to remember.",
